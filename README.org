* An Emacs minor mode for template-related errors in C++
~tspew~ addresses the "template spew" problem for C++ coders.
This minor mode runs during compilation of C++ code and reformats long error messages to be easier to read.
It indents template type names according to their hierarchy, adding newlines as required
to eliminate run-on lines.
It also provides functions to "fold" expressions to hide or reveal lower level details, for readability.

* Usage
** Installation
*** package.el
This package is available from [[https://jcs-emacs.github.io/jcs-elpa/][JCS-ELPA]]. Install from these repositories then you should be good to go!

Normally, you don't need to add ~(require 'tspew)~ to your configuration since most ~tspew~ commands are autoload and can be called without loading the module!
*** Manual installation
Install ~tspew.el~ somewhere in your ~load-path~

In your init file:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-hook 'compilation-mode-hook #'tspew-mode)
#+END_SRC
** Displaying formatted types and functions within error messages
- Formatting occurs as compilation results arrive and are complete when the compile finishes
- To remove all formatting, exit the minor mode with ~M-x tspew-mode~
** Reducing detail in types
- The command ~tspew-fold~, when run with a numeric argument, will replace text around point that is at or below that depth in parentheses (or brackets) with ellipses =...= A ~nil~ argument will restore everything.
  - The text within quotes at that point will be reformatted
- You can incrementally increase or decrease the detail shown using ~tspew-increase-detail~ (bound to ~C-c +~) and ~tspew-decrease-detail~ (bound to ~C-c -~)
